## Synopsis

This is a simple adventure game example that was written using C++ and Qt5 (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt5-intro.html).  The code could still use plenty of cleanup.

## Prerequisites

Qt5 developer tools must be installed (qt5-qmake, qt5-devel, ...)

## Compiling

make clean && make

## Running

./game
